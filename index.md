### WebSci'20 Workshop:
## Evolutionary thinking for the Web

The Web has been attributed with compelling evolutionary qualities, likening it to an ecosystem that entails processes of competition and adaptation. Informal biological metaphors of this kind could benefit from further examination. This workshop (hosted by the Web Science conference) aims to bring together researchers who work at the intersection of evolution and the Web. The workshop will provide a channel for computer scientists and social scientists to come together, exchange views and establish collaboration towards evolutionary and cognitive approaches for studying social and technological change on the Web.

### Call for papers
We invite short or full paper submissions on topics such as:  
- the application of evolutionary theory to digital trends
- empirical opportunities and tools to study evolution in the Web
- critical discussion or literature review of these themes

All papers should be 2-10 pages long and formatted according to the ACM SIG Conference proceedings template, available at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. Please submit papers via EasyChair at ref.   
Workshop papers will be published in a companion collection of the ACM WebSci'20 proceedings.

### Important Dates

April 17, 2020 - Workshop paper submission deadline  
May 15, 2020 - Camera ready papers due  
July 7, 2020 - Workshop date  
July 8, 2020 - Optional poster reception. Authors are encouraged to showcase their work in the form of posters at the joint conference and workshop poster reception. 

### Programme
To be confirmed.  

Due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19), the WebSci'20 conference organisers are currently exploring opportunities for online (remote) participation. Updates will be shared on this webpage and via email to authors.

### Background Information

Evolutionary approaches started becoming popular in the social sciences just over three decades ago, when academics began using mathematical models to explain the emergent diversity and complexity of technologies, language and religion (Boyd & Richerson, 1988; Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman, 1981). Today, evolutionary thinking has expanded across scholars from a wide range of disciplines in the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities and complexity sciences (Richerson & Christiansen, 2013; Valverde, 2016). The main premise of this research is that cultural entities change over time through a Darwinian process of “descent with modification” (Mesoudi, 2011), where small-scale mechanisms operate gradually to create changes that are observable on a larger scale.
This kind of thinking complements the intention of Web Science to analyse and discover the microscopic laws that generate observable behaviours and patterns on a large scale (Berners-Lee et al 2006). Analogies between biological evolution and technological evolution are very pertinent to digital media and software such as the Web. Similar to the role of genomes in living organisms, software encodes and transfers the information that determines how a technology functions and expresses itself (Valverde, 2016). There is also socially generated information, whose transmission and accumulation can be traced online in ways that surpass offline media. This has led researchers to investigate current topics such as the spread of online misinformation, cognitive biases, echo chambers and filter bubbles (Acerbi, 2019; Smart, 2018).
The biological roots of evolutionary and cognitive approaches provide not only a compelling theoretical framework, but also a heritage of robust analytic tools that seek to quantify complex and subjective social phenomena. The goal of this workshop will be to introduce evolutionary theory and methods through speakers who have applied them in their own research. We will also invite the audience and panellists to share Web Science topics that are of interest to them, so that we can discuss how these themes might be addressed using evolutionary and cognitive approaches. Researchers who are working on projects related to this theme are invited to submit papers.
