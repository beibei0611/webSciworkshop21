### WebSci'20 workshop:
## Evolutionary thinking for the Web

The Web has been attributed with compelling evolutionary qualities, likening it to an ecosystem that entails processes of competition and adaptation. However, empirical examination of these biological metaphors is only starting to gain momentum. This workshop aims to bring together diverse communities of academics carrying out rigorous research at the intersection of evolution and the Web. This event will provide a channel for computer scientists and social scientists to come together, exchange views and establish collaboration towards evolutionary and cognitive approaches for studying social and technological change on the Web.

### Call for papers
We invite short papers on topics such as:  
- the application of evolutionary theory to digital trends
- empirical opportunities and tools to study evolution in the Web
- critical discussion or literature review on these themes

Papers should be 2-3 pages long and formatted according to the ACM SIG Conference proceedings template, available at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. Please submit papers via EasyChair at ref.   
Workshop papers will be published in a companion collection of the ACM WebSci'20 proceedings.
