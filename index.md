### WebSci'20 Workshop:
## Evolutionary thinking for the Web

The Web has been the subject of compelling biological metaphors that liken it to an evolving ecosystem. Analogies of this kind could benefit from further theoretical and empirical examination. To address this, evolutionary and cognitive approaches provide not only a powerful theoretical framework, but also a heritage of robust analytic tools that help to quantify complex and subjective social and technological phenomena. The goal of this workshop will be to discuss how evolutionary approaches can inform our understanding of the Web at present, as well as methodological challenges and opportunities to shape its evolution into the future.   

This half-day workshop (hosted online by the [Web Science conference](https://websci20.webscience.org/)) features an extended panel session with speakers who have been pioneering work at the intersection of evolution and the Web. The discussion will bring into conversation perspectives from evolutionary anthropology, cognitive sciences and engineering.

## Panellists:
### [Dr Alberto Acerbi](https://acerbialberto.com/) – “Cultural evolution on the web”
"Cultural evolution - a byword for evolutionary and cognitive approaches to human culture - can provide a useful framework to understand how information is produced, transmitted, and selected on the web. Human culture is cumulative, meaning that it increases in complexity and efficiency from one generation to another, drawing on past innovations. Cumulation, however, differs depending on the specific domain. Two features of cultural systems impact the velocity and the robustness of cumulation: availability, i.e. the number of possible cultural traits one has access to, and fidelity of transmission, i.e. the degree to which cultural traits are preserved during transmission. I will discuss how the diffusion of online digital media increases both availability and fidelity, thus boosting the potential for cultural cumulation, possibly in domains where it was before limited." 

Alberto Acerbi is a lecturer in Psychology at the Centre for Culture and Evolution, Brunel University London. Alberto is a cognitive/evolutionary anthropologist with a particular interest in computational science. He recently wrote the book [“Cultural evolution in the digital age”](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age-9780198835943?cc=gb&lang=en&) for Oxford University Press.

### [Dr Paul Smart](http://paulsmart.cognosys.co.uk/)
Paul Smart is a senior research fellow in Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Southampton. His research interests lie at the interface of the network, web and cognitive sciences. Paul’s [recent work](http://paulsmart.cognosys.co.uk/pubs/2017/Machine%20Intelligence%20and%20the%20Social%20Web.pdf?LMCL=ND9E1e) has explored the notion of ecological engineering/niche construction and the ‘evolution’ of human/machine intelligence, with the Internet/Web as a central topic of concern.

### [Professor James Hendler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hendler)
James Hendler is the Director of the Institute for Data Exploration and Applications and the Tetherless World Professor of Computer, Web and Cognitive Sciences at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). James has authored over 400 books, technical papers and articles in areas such as the Semantic Web and artificial intelligence. One of his interests is the evolution of [social machines](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370209001404) through the accumulated knowledge and interactions of humankind.

## Background

In the recent decades, evolutionary approaches have been gathering momentum across academics from a wide range of disciplines that seek to understand the emergent diversity and complexity of technologies and cultural traits. The main premise of this research is that small-scale evolutionary mechanisms operate gradually to create changes that are observable on a larger scale ([Mesoudi, 2011](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cultural-Evolution-Darwinian-Synthesize-Sciences/dp/0226520447)). This thinking complements the intention of Web Science to analyse the microscopic laws that generate emergent behaviour and patterns in the Web ([Berners-Lee et al, 2006](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5788/769)). 

Analogies between biological evolution and technological evolution are being used by social scientists who study digital media and software, as well as by engineers who build these systems. Similar to the role of genomes in living organisms, software encodes and transfers the information that determines how a technology functions and expresses itself ([Valverde, 2016](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2015.0450)). There is also socially generated information, whose transmission and accumulation can be traced online in ways that surpass offline media. Current topics of interest in this area include the spread of online misinformation, cognitive biases and echo chambers ([Acerbi, 2019](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cultural-Evolution-Digital-Alberto-Acerbi/dp/0198835949); [Smart, 2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-017-1414-z)).

Insights from evolutionary and cognitive approaches hold promise for the future of machine intelligence ([Smart, 2017](http://paulsmart.cognosys.co.uk/pubs/2017/Machine%20Intelligence%20and%20the%20Social%20Web.pdf?LMCL=ND9E1e)), presenting challenges and opportunities to engineer infrastructures that support the accumulated knowledge and interactions of humankind ([Hendler, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370209001404)). Data sharing is central to this process, entailing additional matters of legal and ethical best practice for the structures that evolve through human data ([Wilson et al, 2016](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2911187.2914579)).
