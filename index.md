### WebSci'20 workshop:
## Evolutionary thinking for the Web

The Web has been attributed with compelling evolutionary qualities, where it is likened to an ecosystem that entails processes of competition and adaptation. However, these biological metaphors have been discussed largely through informal means. This workshop aims to bring together active communities of academics already carrying out research at the intersection of evolution and the Web. By providing an opportunity for these researchers to come together, we hope to exchange views and establish collaboration. The workshop will consist of one or two talks followed by an interactive panel session. We will discuss some of the theoretical and empirical opportunities provided by evolutionary and cognitive approaches for the study of social and technological change on the Web. Researchers who are working on projects related to this theme are invited to submit short papers.
